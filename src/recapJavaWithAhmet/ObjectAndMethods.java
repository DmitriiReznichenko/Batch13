FACEBOOK INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

1-What is object? and tell me about a few method of it?
    **Object is a presentation of the class(blueprint)
      There are many methods of object but we focus on these:
    -->.equals()--> which is comparison
    -->toString --> it shows all the variables in a string form
    -->.Hashcode --> location of the element(object)

 2- What is the difference btw object and class?

 Object and Class:
 Class ==> is a blue-print/templates which you can create as many as object you like
 Class ==> one class can have one scenario
 Class ==> is declared with CLASS keyword --> parent
 Object ==> is a member of instance of a class
 Object ==> you can create as many as you want
 Object ==> is the all childs of the class -->child


3- How do you initialize the instance and local variables?
  **There are different ways to initialize the instance variables:
  -->Constructor
  -->Methods(getters and setters)
  -->directly assign the value (by passing value)
  -->with Object(create and object and call it)


4-What is the difference btw instance and local variable?
  **Instance Variables:                     **Local Variables
  ->belong to the class                     ->belong to the block of code(method)
  ->has default values(null,0,0.0)n         ->it doesn't have default values(have to initialize)
  ->can have access modifiers               ->cannot have access modifiers
