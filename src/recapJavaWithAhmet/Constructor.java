/*
1- What is constructor? and what is the purpose of it?

* Constructor is a way to initialize the instance variables.
** Constructor assign values the values to the objects features

2- Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method?

 - Constructor doesn't have return type
 - Method must have return type

 - Constructor must have the same name as a class
 - Method May or May not have the same name as a class

3- Can you make the constructor static, private or final?

 - You can not make the constructor static or final, But as you know I am a special tester that use different
  ways to improve my framework. That's why I CAN Make the constructor by using singleton pattern
  design in my automation.
  Why: make you constructor private in your singleton?
  -> I make my constructor private because I don't want anyone to initialize my driver from that class.


4- What is the differences between this, this(), super, super()?

this --> refers to the class's instance variables and methods;
this() --> refers to constructor from same class IT MUST BE ON THE FIRST LINE OF THE CODE

super --> refers to parent's instance variables;
super() --> it refers to parent's constructor IT MUST BE ON THE FIRST LINE OF THE CODE
