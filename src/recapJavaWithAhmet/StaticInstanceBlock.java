    /*POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

    1- what is static as a keyword and why do you use it?
        Static ( as key word) is a way to make your methods and variables accessible from other classes. It means you
           can access these methods and variables without creating an object.***
           *the advantage of having static keyword is that you don't need to create  an object.
           *the disadvantage of static keyword you cannot Override the static methods
            *the disadvantage of static keyword you cannot call static methods, variables inside of non static methods.


           Note: I can definitely say static  as a keyword is really useful for my project****


    2- what is static block and instance block?

    *These are type of block that called from system Immediatly. It means you do  not need to call it directly.
    --> static block-->it will run only once and  always first line!!
    --> instance block --> it will run as many as objects you have.


    3- what id static variables?
         it makes the valiable belong to the class
         *it is shared( changable for each object) --> common for each object
