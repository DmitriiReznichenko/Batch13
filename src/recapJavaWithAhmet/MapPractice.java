    Possible interview questions:

    1- Can you tell me about map and how do you use it in your project?


    Map is an awesome interface that I used in my project to store my data as KEY-VALUE PAIRS.


    2- What is the connection between Map and Collection?

    *They are all useful for the project for different purposes.
    *As I mentioned before set is all about uniqueness, list is all about duplication
    and efficiency. Map is all about key-value pairs.
    Show off notes: Hey Madam/Sir As you know,Key part of the map must be Unique,
    Value part can be Duplicates
    ******So based  on this, I can say Map is a combination of List and Set************
    LIST-->REFERS TO VALUE******* SET --> REFERS TO KEY*********




    3- What is the type of Map and difference between them?

    ORDERS BASED ON KEYS -->ahmet=2,mehmet=3,burak=6;
     --> HashSet --> it stores the element no order(randomly)
   -->LinkHashSet--> it stores the element insertion order ( the way that you assign)
   --> TreeSet --> it stores the element ascending order.


    4- What is synchronization ? Can you give an example?

    * synchronization --> it executes any actions one by one.(one after anothet)

    --> we have two most common synchronized concept--> Hashtable, -->String Buffer

    *** Synchronized system is *** THREAD-SAFE*** and ***SLOW***
    non-synchronized system is ***not thread-safe*** but is fast***

    *Great Example for non-synchronized is Map

    Task: I want you get the output of total items
    output: apple=3, Banana=2,Peach=1,Orange=2,Strawberry=1

    Tip: You can consider a method of containsKey from map.
